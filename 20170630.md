# Perfect Editor

For the past couple of days, I've been thinking of switching back to phpstorm as my main editor.
Vim + tmux has been my editor for a year now and I have to say, I'm in love with how easy it is to navigate which makes me more productive.
But it wasn't perfect, I kinda miss the IDE's perfect lint, highlighting un-imported classes, highlighting unused imports, and other IDE stuff.
I know there are great plugins for vim to do these tasks, but they aren't as good as how IDE's handle them.

Earlier today, I remembered a friend told me that phpstorm has a plugin called ideaVim that adds vim support, so I gave it a try.
IdeaVim was doing its job fine but phpstorm + ideaVim wasn't perfect either due to issues such as: no split pane (window split isn't that good), the use the mouse to navigate on the project explorer, the file opens on a new window instead of the current window, and the lack of flexibility in the key binding.
Uhhh. It is so frustrating that I can't have the perfect feature of phpstorm and vim in one editor. ðŸ˜µ
