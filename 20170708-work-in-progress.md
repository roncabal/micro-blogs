# Work In Progress

I'm currently working on a frontend project, a very simple one.
It's just a one page responsive site with a modernistic look to it.
I'm kinda happy about this project because the timeline given, for its size, is very long.
I know, for sure, that I can finish it in two days or less.
However, I want to take this opportunity to experiment, try new things, and hone my frontend skills (specifically CSS development).
This isn't a Javascript heavy project so Vanilla JS would probably do.
I've organized my CSS before on my previous projects, but it still felt so cluttered after finishing them.
So for this project, I'm going to try out ITCSS architecture + BEM.
I know this isn't necessary and probably an overkill for this project, but when will be the perfect case to practice things? On large projects with tight deadlines?

Anyway, I think this project would be perfect to try new things and I'm excited about how it will turn out.
