# Music

It's always easier for me to do work when I listen to music.
This year is probably one of the best years for me with regards to music since almost every band I listen to released their new albums.
The reason why I got motivated to write this blog is because one of my favorite bands, The Drums, just released their new album ‘Abysmal Thoughts’ today! Another favorite is Beach Fossils who also released their new album ‘Somersault’ a few weeks back.
I got mixed feelings towards both albums but most of them are positive.

With all these bands releasing new albums, I was able to discover other amazing bands that really fit my taste along the way.
One of them is Fazerdaze who also released a new album called Morningside which I've been listening to for a couple of weeks now.

My playlist has been growing rapidly this year and so far, I'm really enjoying it!
