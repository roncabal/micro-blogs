# Work In Progress 2

Last tuesday, I finished the frontend project which I mentioned on my previous blog.
I wasn't able to write about it earlier as I have been sick for 3 days now and I really hate it.
Although I feel a bit better now, I still find it hard to focus properly and still need some rest from time to time.

Anyway, I find ITCSS very helpful especially for large projects as it forces developers to organize their codes properly.
CSS specificity can also be manageable that it is very rare for developers to write a long css selector or add an !important to the style just to override a style.
Also, since the codes are separated into sections or folders (if combined with preprocessors), it is easy to find which part or file to edit.

Combining ITCSS and BEM makes it more convenient for me to add or edit lines of codes since I can easily know which styles to edit for each markup, component, and whatnot.
Collaboration will also be a breeze as long as everyone who will be part of the development knows how ITCSS and BEM work, they can easily jump into development and do stuff.
