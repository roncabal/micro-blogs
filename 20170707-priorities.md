# Priorities

Last night, I had some time to reflect on the decisions I've been making in the past months of my life—from the little things to the huge ones—mostly about career and personal growth.
I realized that most of my decisions have either slowed me down or put me to a sudden stop.
Mainly because I've been favoring short term happiness over working on my long term goal.
Procrastination has gotten out of hand that it is so easy for me to fall into the trap of instant gratification than to work and achieve something that I can utilize in the long run.

I've figured out (at least I think) that the issue is my lack of self discipline.
I get easily distracted by things such as video games and social media, so in order to address this problem, I made my initial step to improve self discipline which was to delete all games that have been contributing to it.
It was really hard for me to remove them since I've already spent so much time to reach my current stats in those games.
But reality is more important than games and I have to focus on that.
I'll also list my priorities today, sort them by importance, then put it on my desk where it will always be visible to constantly remind me of what is really important.

Having this random self evaluation, I think, is really helpful for me as it reminds me of what I really have to focus on.
It would probably be better if I make a self evaluation schedule, perhaps quarterly, just so I won't have to wait for that random day to come again.
