# Burn out

Spent a few months working on a project that has a really tight schedule,
so tight that I had to work even on the weekends.
This has caused a lot of stress and anxiety for the entire duration of the project.
Itâ€™s my fault though, I accepted the project cause I wanted to help some folks out. 

Iâ€™m slowly getting back on track though.
I took a few weeks off from the hustle, and now Iâ€™m working on some projects thatâ€™s really interesting and fun.
Planning to write more micro blogs too soon. ðŸ™‚
