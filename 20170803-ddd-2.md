# DDD 2

I've been busy working on different projects since last week that I had no time to work on my study project.
A project where I'm applying what I've learned from reading eBooks and watching talks on YouTube about Domain Driven Design.
It's so much fun learning all these things and I feel a lot more confident with my backend development skills more than ever.

I do still have a lot of questions about DDD, but I know I've learned a lot while working on this project.
This has also opened me to other topics such as Event Sourcing and CQRS which are both really interesting in my opinion.
But for now, having a full understanding of DDD is my goal.

Hopefully, I'll be able to continue my project next week.
I'm also planning to share this Github repo to other developers when I finish it.
Maybe someone who has a high knowledge about the topic will see and maybe even review my work. *fingers crossed*
