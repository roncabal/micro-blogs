# DDD

Last week, I started reading ebooks and articles and watching some videos about Domain Driven Design.
I think I've fallen deep down the rabbit hole about DDD and different design patterns, but I'm really happy I did.
It feels like I'm making progress again with my backend development skills by learning all of these.
But I think I have to go easy with the gas and move a bit slower.
Learning a lot about different stuff on one go hurts my brain and leaves me with so many questions.
I tried googling my questions.
Some of my questions were answered straight to the point; some have more than one answer that made me even more confused as people have different opinions about the subject and their answers contradicts each other; and, some are just really hard to google since the questions are really long.

Learning all these things alone with only books, videos, and articles to work with is hard IMO.
It's hard in a sense that I cannot validate myself if I'm doing things the right way.
It would be awesome to be mentored by someone who really knows these kinds of stuff.
