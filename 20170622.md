# Improvements

Yesterday, I met up with three of my closest friends from my first job.
It was just a small celebration where we had some really great conversations mostly about our profession, career growth, and how much we enjoy what we're doing right now.
But what I loved the most was the discussion between me and a co-developer, a really good developer and humble person.
Honestly, he's one of the few people I look up to since I started working.
We discussed about the recent happenings in the PHP community, exchanged opinions about it, and agreed with most of each other's insights.

The reason why I enjoyed this particular discussion the most is because I was able to see how much I've improved over the past years.
I was able to fully understand the terms he was using and the way he would approach the problems and how he would implement it, and then I tell my opinion on how I would deal with them.
Unlike before, I had to directly ask him or google things up just to know what he was talking about.
I know I still have a lot to learn but acknowledging these improvements motivates me more to study and be more knowledgeable about my profession.

Overall, I had a really fun time hanging out with them and I'm looking forward to have more of these exciting conversations with them again very soon.
