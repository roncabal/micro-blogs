# Code for the Maintainer

A few years back, I've read somewhere on the internet that "Code is read more than it is written".
Back then, I didn't fully understand it.
Fast forward to today, where I have gained 5 years of experience as a developer.
I can finally say that I understand why.

In my entire career, I've handled a lot of projects, most of which are inherited from other developers.
From these projects, I have found out that developers have different coding standards and architecture –– some well... doesn't have any of the two.
But hey, the code works.
Yay! But just like all programs, there will always be some unexpected bugs or feature requests from the client.
These usually are the moments where I say, "My time to shine!", but then, it doesn't go well.
The reason is mostly either of the two: 
1.  The task is quite easy, but the codes are undocumented.
I have to reverse engineer the current codes, which takes too much time just to finish my task.
2. I finished my task quickly but since the current codes have no strict implementations, I've produced hidden bugs.
No one wants that, especially on enterprise sized projects.

The lesson I learned from these projects is to STOP assuming that readable codes for me will always be as readable for other developers.
Always think of how I can make it easy for the next maintainer to understand the codes.
Add documentations and/or restrictions in the codes.
I know it's tedious, but just like what they say: "Sometimes you need to slow down to go fast".
