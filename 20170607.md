# Micro blogging 

For the past years of my life, I've been struggling to express myself to people.
Whenever I try, something creeps on my back. It seems like a sign that I should not do it, so I back out.
After sometime, these instances pops back into my head and I start thinking what could have happened if I did not back out.
Maybe it would have turned out fine, maybe notâ€”who knows?
But it always feels like an opportunity that I did not take, then I start to regret not doing it.

Here's the thing though, I want to change that.
I want to help myself learn how to speak my mind.
This might be one of the small steps that I'm going to take to overcome it.
