# A Developer

Whenever I tell people that I am a developer, most commonly to non-tech savvy individuals, they always assume that I simply type words over and over just to create something then get paid for it.
As a person who has issues explaining things, I often fail to let them realize that it's not just that.
I spend a good amount of time thinking of different things such as database architecture, software architecture, design patterns, code optimization, and many more;
I know most developers do too.
"Programming is thinking, not typing", I feel that developers are being undervalued by these people, but can I really blame them?
