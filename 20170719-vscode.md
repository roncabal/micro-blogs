# VSCode

On one of my previous blogs, I talked about the "Perfect Editor".
I think I've found the one really close to what I had in mind.

I've been using VSCode for three days now and I kinda regret not trying it a lot sooner when some developers recommended it to me.
It's just so beautifulâ€”its VIM emulator plugin works very well, even in the explorer sidebar; the default keybindings are very intuitive, editing them is such a breeze and its flexibility is really good; PHP Intelephense plugin for intellisense is almost perfect, I've got some issues with add imports but it is quite bearable; and for my favorite part, the Firewatch Theme.
It just looks soooo gorgeous and it really makes me want to code now more than ever. <3

I do encounter some minor issues with vscode but they are bearable.
I'll give VSCode a month, try it on actual project development to see if it can be my main editor and retire my vim+tmux setup.
So far, I'm really loving it and I'm really excited to discover more of its features and plugins.
